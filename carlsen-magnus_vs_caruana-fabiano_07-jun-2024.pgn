This is the so-called Petrosian Variation of the Queen's Indian Defense. The
idea behind ​​White's fifth move is to avoid the pin with ...Bb4, now creating
the positional threat of playing d4-d5, gaining space in the center. This line
was a favorite of the young Garry Kasparov, and I remember studying as a
teenager some beautiful wins in his fabulous book \"The Test of Time.\"} 5...
Ne4 $5 {[%c_effect e4;square;e4;type;Interesting;persistent;true] A rarer option
than the pawn advance to d5, but also perfectly playable. This was the move
played by Ulf Andersson in the game against Kasparov, one of the 13th world
champion's most famous victories.} (5... d5 {is the main move.}) 6. Nxe4 Bxe4 7.
e3 (7. Nd2 {is the move played by Kasparov. The natural idea is to remove the
bishop and then play e2-e4. Objectively, it seems that this move offers better
chances for an advantage.} 7... Bg6 {A strange diagonal for the bishop.} (7...
Bb7 {is better.}) 8. g3 Nc6 9. e3 {with a small advantage for White in
Kasparov-Andersson, Tilburg 1981.}) 7... Be7 8. Bd3 {The most played move with
the idea of ​​exchanging bishops and then occupying the center with the pawn.}
(8. Be2 {is also possible:} 8... O-O 9. O-O {with a normal position.}) 8... Bxd3
(8... d5 $1 {[%c_effect d5;square;d5;type;GreatFind;persistent;true] I have the
impression, or maybe I'm being influenced by the computer, that this is the best
way to equalize the game.}) 9. Qxd3 O-O 10. O-O d6 (10... d5 {is also possible,
but White has a slightly more comfortable position after} 11. e4) 11. b4 (11. e4
{is also possible.}) 11... Nd7 12. Rd1 a5 13. Bb2 (13. b5 {is an interesting
alternative, preventing exchanges on the a-file.}) 13... axb4 14. axb4 Qb8

Caruana's idea is to play Qb7, exchange rooks, and play Ra8.} 15. Qe4 {[%c_arrow
e4c6;keyPressed;none;from;e4;opacity;0.8;to;c6;persistent;false] A tempting move
with the idea of placing the queen on c6, but Black can equalize the game.} (15.
d5 e5 16. Nd2 {keeps a space advantage and a tiny plus in the position.}) 15...
d5 (15... Nf6 {requires subtle play but is also enough:} 16. Qc6 Qe8 $1

Qxc7 Rc8 18. Qxb6 Rxc4 {[%c_arrow

with enough compensation for the pawn.}) 16. cxd5 Nf6 (16... Qb7 $1 {[%c_effect
b7;square;b7;type;GreatFind;persistent;true] is more accurate.}) 17. Qc2 exd5
{If I were playing this game, I must admit that I'd have trouble knowing whether
it's better to take with the pawn or with the knight, but Caruana's choice is
probably the best: this way, he doesn't have to worry about the white center
advancing.} (17... Nxd5 18. b5 Qb7 {is the alternative.}) 18. Ne5 Bd6 19. b5 Qe8
20. Rxa8 Qxa8 21. Ra1 Qe8 22. Qc6 Qe7 23. Ra7 {[%c_highlight

White has a comfortable position since he has more space, but the problem is
that, for now, there's nothing to attack. The same position without the
dark-squared bishops, for example, would be difficult for Black, but as it
stands, the bishop defends the c7-pawn and the knight defends the d5-pawn.}
23... h5 24. h3 Rd8 (24... Rc8 {[%c_highlight
c7;keyPressed;none;opacity;0.8;square;c7;persistent;false] The rook fulfills a
more useful function on this rather ugly square, as it defends the c7-pawn after
White's plan of exchanging bishops.}) 25. Qc1 $1 {[%c_effect
c1;square;c1;type;GreatFind;persistent;true][%c_arrow
b2a3;keyPressed;none;from;b2;opacity;0.8;to;a3;persistent;false] With the idea
of ​​playing Ba3 to exchange the bishops.} 25... Qe6 (25... Qe8 $5 {[%c_effect
e8;square;e8;type;Interesting;persistent;true] is also possible, with the idea
of} 26. Nc6 (26. Ba3 Bxe5 27. dxe5 Qxe5 {transposes to a variation that will be
analyzed later.}) 26... Ra8 $1 {[%c_effect

{[%c_effect e5;square;e5;type;GreatFind;persistent;true]} (27... Ne8 {is too
passive.}) 28. Bb2 $1 {[%c_effect b2;square;b2;type;GreatFind;persistent;true] The
best practical chance.} (28. Qxc7 Qxc7 29. Rxc7 d4 $1 {[%c_effect

such damage to your pawn structure.} 29. Bxf6 gxf6 30. Qxc7 d4 $1 {[%c_effect
d4;square;d4;type;GreatFind;persistent;true]} 31. exd4 Rxd4 {Objectively, the
position is equal, but in practice, there are still some problems Black has to
deal with.}) 26... Re8 (26... Rc8 {is again a more useful square for the rook.})

Bxd6 Qxd6 29. Ne5 Rc8 {Here, White can claim a small advantage, but Carlsen's
next move is a mistake.} 30. f3 $2 {[%c_effect

e3.} (30. Ra2 {[%c_arrow
a2c2;keyPressed;none;from;a2;opacity;0.8;to;c2;persistent;false] is a better
chance, followed by Rc2, and Black has to defend for quite some time.}) 30...

e8;square;e8;type;GreatFind;persistent;true] Now White is the one that should be
careful.} 33. Qa3 {It seems that this is the only move to achieve a draw—the
same as losing in armageddon.} 33... Qxa3 34. Rxa3 Rxe3 (34... Nf5 {is also
possible.}) 35. Kf2 Nf5 36. g4 Nd6 $1 {[%c_effect

is captured, Black regains material with the ...Nc4+ fork. White will be able to
make a draw with accurate defense.}) 33. Kf2 Kh7 (33... Nf5 {leads to an
immediate draw after} 34. Ra8 Rxa8 35. Qxa8+ Kh7 36. Qe8 Qg3+ 37. Kg1 Qg5 38.

move to be played with little time on the clock, not fearing a discovered
check.} (34... g6 {is the move I expected when watching the game live.}) 35. Qc2

accurate:} 36. Kg1 Ng3 {[%c_highlight

has no good way to exploit the discovered check and defend against the attack on
the c7-pawn.}) 36. Ne5+ (36. Nf4+ $1 {[%c_effect

forget both players were in time trouble.} 36... f5 37. Ra1 {[%c_arrow

with the idea of Rc1 and going back with the knight to e5.}) 36... Ne4+ $1
{[%c_effect e4;square;e4;type;GreatFind;persistent;true] The only move, but good
enough. Black now has a draw, but against Carlsen, nothing is easy.} (36...

moves were natural, and the game turned into a queen endgame, the most difficult
in chess (in my opinion). Here, for instance, just one move saves Black, and
finding it with seconds on the clock is difficult.} 42... Qb1+ $2 {[%c_effect

White's king is improved. I encourage the diligent reader to continue the
analysis here.}) 44. Qxh4+ Kg6 (44... Kg8 {is more stubborn, but it also loses:}
